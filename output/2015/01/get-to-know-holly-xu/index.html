</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>There's a recurring theme in these interviews&mdash;taking risks. Overcoming
self-esteem issues is a huge part of being a woman in computing. This week I
sat down with Holly Xu, a fourth year student, to talk about her transition
into CS from accounting, how a robotics club boosted her confidence, and the
importance of independence.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of Holly Xu" src="/images/holly_xu.png" title="Holly Xu" /></p>
<p>Holly had a difficult decision to make when it came to applying to university.
She had always been interested in computers, but she faced familial pressure to
apply for accounting, an industry with a traditionally secure job market.</p>
<p>In high school, she was a website and t-shirt designer for the robotics club.
She had always declined offers from her teammates to learn how to solder and
cut metal. Despite her experience in web development, Holly felt like she was
not cut out for computer science because of her inexperience with writing
algorithms. She believed her interest in web development was more of an
artistic hobby.</p>
<p>Despite receiving multiple offers to engineering programs, Holly settled on the
Mathematics/Chartered Professional Accountancy program at the University of
Waterloo. Between her first and second year, she realized she had no passion
whatsoever for accounting. She envied her engineering friends who worked on
exciting software projects.</p>
<p>"Dude&mdash;why am I not like you?!" she recalls thinking.</p>
<p>Holly's interests in computer science grew during a first year summer job in
IT. She asserted her new-found confidence and switched programs before seeking
approval from her parents. As an existing student in the Math faculty, the
process was straightforward.</p>
<p>"I realized any form that I sign at the university doesn't need parental
consent. All you need is determination&mdash;visit the CS advisors."</p>
<p>As a CS student, Holly faced low self-esteem. In high school, she was
accustomed to excelling with little effort. School was a "big kick in the face"
because it felt like she was competing with all the "smart people" who had
impressive grades and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. She didn't believe she was "smart
enough," relying heavily on her family and friends for reassurance.</p>
<p>"Everyone here is smart&mdash;don't let that discourage you. Learn to think
more independently," Holly advises.</p>
<p>At school, Holly had no mentors she could turn to for advice on self-esteem.
Holly had peers she admired but never reached out to, which she regrets.</p>
<p>The mentorships she had during co-op helped her to develop more confidence.
Holly's mentors have supported her growth as a software engineer without
patronizing her for being a woman. One of her first mentors, Leith Abdulla,
encouraged her to ask more questions that were intimidating to ask.</p>
<p>"He's a great communicator," she recalls. "Whenever I had problems, he would
try to approach it from my perspective. It was really helpful."</p>
<p>In addition to achieving career goals during co-op, Holly is grateful for being
able to travel and meet new people. She enjoys working at companies with many
interns. Last term, she had a blast working with her close friend Jackie Baek
in Venice Beach.</p>
<p>Jackie spent an entire term convincing Holly to join her in the same co-op
placement. "To get me to go to a different city&mdash;it was her complete
doing."</p>
<p>Holly describes Venice Beach as a touristy, sunny, and laid-back rural area
tucked away in Los Angeles. The fact that it was not a technological hub like
Silicon Valley encouraged her to go outside and try activities like surfing.</p>
<p>"In Silicon Valley, Waterloo interns tend to just hang out with other Waterloo
interns," she observes. "Travel to new places like Seattle or Austin! Meet new
people who can offer new perspectives."</p>
<p>"Living it out" is what Holly describes her attitude towards having new
experiences. This attitude has made her more self-reliant&mdash;making her
more comfortable with offering support to others. Based on her experiences
mentoring high school students in robotics club, she believes that mentorships
should be treated as friendships.</p>
<p>"I wish I was part of more opportunities to help women gain confidence in STEM.
If you have any questions and would like to talk, I would love to help! I
didn't realize how much young Holly needed it."</p>
