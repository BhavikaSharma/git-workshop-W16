    <h1 class="entry-title">FAQ</h1>
    
    <p>Here you will find answers to questions we commonly receive. If you have a
question not listed below, please do not hesitate to <a href="/contact-us/">reach
out</a> to us!</p>
<h2>What does &ldquo;women-only&rdquo; mean?</h2>
<p>Our women-only events are open to cis and trans women, and non-binary individuals.</p>
<h2>Why do you sometimes hold women-only events?</h2>
<p>Holding events which are only open to women helps some women deal with
<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Exceptionalism" title="Geek Feminism Wiki: Exceptionalism">exceptionalism</a> and
<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Stereotype_threat" title="Geek Feminism Wiki: Stereotype Threat">stereotype threat</a>.</p>
<p>An example of an event that's women-only is our mentoring program, where we
match up junior female students with more senior female students to talk
about their experiences and support them throughout their academic career.
Women can obviously seek out male mentors as well, but they don't quite share
the same experiences so the impact of the mentoring is not the same. There
are also events that are traditionally very competitive (such as hackathons)
that women feel more comfortable coming out to if they're women-only.</p>
<p>Our women-only events are not publicly advertised and we always specify
<strong>very explicitly</strong> if an event is going to be women-only.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>Please see the <strong>Volunteer Opportunities</strong> section on our <a href="/about/">About
page</a>!</p>
<h2>I have a food sensitivity. Can you accomodate me at catered events?</h2>
<p>Yes, we would be happy to! Please try to notify us of your allergies at
least a week in advance of the event. We usually have vegetarian, vegan,
halal, and gluten-free options available.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between this WiCS group and the at-large committee?</h2>
<p>The Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee (this group) is a
subcommittee of the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/wics">Women in Computer Science
Committee</a>, a standing committee of the David R.
Cheriton School of Computer Science. While the larger committee is dedicated to
supporting all women in computer science at the University of Waterloo,
including incoming students, graduate students, faculty, and staff, we focus
primarily on undergraduates.</p>
<p>The at-large WiCS committee also serves as an advocacy group, working with many
different areas within the School of Computer Science such as
curriculum-building, recruiting, and student engagement. The WiCS Undergraduate
Committee primarily focuses on supporting women enrolled or interested in
computer science programs at the University, building community and promoting a
dialogue around women's issues and diversity at the undergraduate level.</p>
<h2>Does WiCS ever work with external organizations, such as companies?</h2>
<p>Yes! Occasionally, the WiCS Undergraduate will work with companies that reach
out and want to help out with events and other things that require funding.</p>
