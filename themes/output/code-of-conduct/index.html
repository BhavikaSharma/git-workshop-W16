    <h1 class="entry-title">Code of Conduct</h1>
    
    <p>Our Code of Conduct is our commitment to the community to provide a welcoming,
safe space for all its participants.</p>
<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>A primary goal of the WiCS Undergraduate Committee is to be inclusive towards
and supportive of women interested in computer science.</p>
<p>Additionally, we seek to include and support members of all underrepresented
groups in the fields of technology and computing, with the most varied and
diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a
friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack
thereof).</p>
<p>We invite all those who participate in our events and who communicate with our
community at large to help us create a safe and positive experiences for
everyone involved.</p>
<p>We've outlined a code of conduct to highlight our expectations for all
individuals who participate in our community, as well as the steps to handle
unacceptable behavior.</p>
<h1>Expected Behavior</h1>
<ul>
<li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to
  the health and longevity of this community.</li>
<li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li>
<li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this
Code of Conduct, <a href="mailto:wics-ugrad@lists.uwaterloo.ca">contact the committee</a>.
No situation is considered inconsequential. If you do not feel comfortable
contacting the committee at large due to the nature of the incident, you may
contact the <a href="/our-volunteers/">Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee
Chair</a> or the Chair of the at-large Women in Computer
Science Committee, currently <a href="mailto:jmatlee@uwaterloo.ca">Jo Atlee</a>.</p>
<h1>Unacceptable Behavior</h1>
<p><strong>Unacceptable behaviors include:</strong> intimidating, harassing, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in
our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications
carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be
shared; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>
<p><strong>Harassment includes:</strong> harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments
related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including
presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing
photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<h1>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h1>
<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a
temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and
without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>
<h1>Experiencing Unacceptable Behavior</h1>
<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify an organizer as soon as possible (contact info below).</p>
<p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members
engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers
will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>
<h1>Addressing Grievances</h1>
<p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should contact the at-large Women in Computer Science Committee
Chair, currently <a href="mailto:jmatlee@uwaterloo.ca">Jo Atlee</a>, with a concise
description of your grievance.</p>
<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>We expect all community participants (participants, organizers, sponsors, and
other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community
venues&mdash;online and in-person&mdash;as well as in all one-on-one
communications pertaining to community business.</p>
